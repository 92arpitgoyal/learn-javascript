================

This post (book?) is a work-in-progess (labour of love) which I have been 
planning for 5 years and have notes for in various paper/online notebooks.
I decided to follow Addy Osmani's example and *write* this on GitHub.

His book **Learning JavaScript Design Patterns** (see below) is shared

Learning JavaScript is no longer *optional* for people that want to build
amazing web sites, apps & experiences. But getting started can be daunting.
A quick 
[search for JavaScript](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=javascript) 
on Amazon yields over *five thousand results*! Mercifully you do not have 
to be overwhelmed by the ocean of books/tutorials/videos!

Unlike most of my colleagues I am not a (*formally* trained) Computer Scientist
or "Software Engineer", I created my own curriculum and learned by doing.
To a non-programmer it might look like I *bluffed* my way into getting paid
to write code, but that could not be *further* from the truth. 
With enough dedication, coding is something *anyone* can learn.

# Where do I Start?!

## Option 1

Read a *shelf* of books to acquire the knowledge of *expert* developers.

Here are 11 I have learned a lot from and *recommend*:

Since JavaScript does not operate in isolation in the Web Browser,
you will need to have some **Basic HTML & CSS** knowledge to get started:

- Basics of Web Design: HTML5 and CSS3 (Terry Felke-Morris 
2011 - **368** pages)
http://www.amazon.com/Basics-Web-Design-HTML5-CSS3/dp/0137003382/

![Basics of Web Design: HTML5 & CSS3](http://www-fp.pearsonhighered.com/coverimage/0133128911.jpg "Basics of Web Design: HTML5 & CSS3")

After you know a bit of HTML & CSS 
Keith & Sambells (2010) will give you a *gentle* and interesting introduction 
to the Document Object Model (DOM) and how to use JavaScript in the browser:

- DOM Scripting: Web Design with JavaScript and the Document Object Model (Jeremy Keith & Jeffrey Sambells 2010 - **336** pages)
http://www.amazon.com/DOM-Scripting-Design-JavaScript-Document/dp/1430233893/

![DOM Scripting](http://img2.imagesbn.com/p/9781430233893_p0_v2_s260x420.JPG "DOM Scripting")

Once you have some foundational web development skills you can pick a book
that is *focussed* on learning JavaScript with plenty of tutorials:

- Javascript for **Beginners** (Mark Lassoff 2013 - **292** pages):
http://www.amazon.com/Javascript-Beginners-Mr-Mark-Lassoff/dp/0988842955/

![Javascript for Beginners](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51%2B0LwpmLqL._SY344_PJlook-inside-v2,TopRight,1,0_SH20_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg "Javascript for Beginners")

Once you have learned basics you need to focus on "**The Good Parts**":

- JavaScript **The Good Parts** (Douglas Crockford 2008 - **147** pages): 
http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742/

![JavaScript: The Good Parts](http://it-ebooks.info/images/ebooks/3/javascript_the_good_parts.jpg "JavaScript: The Good Parts")

Once you have *mastered* the **Good Parts**, begin to *hone* your **craft**
by learning the correct "**Patterns**" for writing efficient code:

- JavaScript **Patterns** (Stoyan Stefanov 2010 - **236** pages): 
http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Patterns-Stoyan-Stefanov/dp/0596806752/

![JavaScript Patterns](http://it-ebooks.info/images/ebooks/3/javascript_patterns.jpg "JavaScript Patterns")

- Learning JavaScript **Design Patterns** (Andy Osmani 2012 - **254** pages):
http://www.amazon.com/Learning-JavaScript-Design-Patterns-Osmani/dp/1449331815/

![Learning JavaScript Design Patterns](http://it-ebooks.info/images/ebooks/3/learning_javascript_design_patterns.jpg "Learning JavaScript Design Patterns")

Now that you know the language *patterns* 
its time for **Test Driven Development** (TDD):

- **Test-Driven** JavaScript Development (Christian Johansen, 2010 - **600** pages):
http://www.amazon.com/Test-Driven-JavaScript-Development-Developers-Library/dp/0321683919/

![Test-Driven JavaScript Development](http://it-ebooks.info/images/ebooks/10/test-driven_javascript_development.jpg "Test-Driven JavaScript Development")

- **Testable** JavaScript (Mark Ethan Trostler 2013 - **274** pages): 
http://www.amazon.com/Testable-JavaScript-Mark-Ethan-Trostler/dp/1449323391/

![Testable JavaScript](http://it-ebooks.info/images/ebooks/3/testable_javascript.jpg "Testable JavaScript")

And if you plan on working in a **team** of more than **one** person, 
you will need to ensure your code is **maintainable**:

- Maintainable JavaScript (Nicholas C. Zakas 2010 - **242** pages):
http://www.amazon.com/Maintainable-JavaScript-Nicholas-C-Zakas/dp/1449327680/

![Maintainable JavaScript](http://it-ebooks.info/images/ebooks/3/maintainable_javascript.jpg "Maintainable JavaScript")

Now you are getting quite good at but your JS code is still not *performing*
like *Google*'s ...

- **High Performance** JavaScript (Nicholas C. Zakas 2010 - **242** pages):
http://www.amazon.com/Performance-JavaScript-Faster-Application-Interfaces/dp/059680279X/

![High Performance JavaScript](http://it-ebooks.info/images/ebooks/3/high_performance_javascript.jpg "High Performance JavaScript")

You're feeling pretty *confident* in your JS skills you want to take it to
"**Ninja**" Level:

- Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja (John Resig 2012 - **392** pages):
http://www.amazon.com/Secrets-JavaScript-Ninja-John-Resig/dp/193398869X/

![Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja](http://it-ebooks.info/images/ebooks/5/secrets_of_the_javascript_ninja.jpg "Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja")

**3303 pages**. If you read a page every 2 minutes 
(bear in mind that this is *code* you need to *understand* because 
later chapters build upon the knowledge so you *cannot skim-read* it...)  
it would take **6600 Minutes** or **110 Hours**.
You could do that in a couple of weeks, *right*...? ;-)
No! Reading an hour a day it would take you **3.5 months** 
(if you didn't skip any days)...

What if someone condensed all that knowledge into a 
**Simple Series of Step-by-Step
Interactive Online Tutorials** ...?

### Introduction

The *Preface* of **JavaScript The Good Parts** (Crockford, 2008) 
*explicitly* says: 

> This is **not** a book **for beginners** ...
> This is **not** a book for **dummies**.

[Douglas Crockford](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Crockford) 
is the Grandfather of JavaScript. 
He poineered using JS for web *application* development in the 90's,
was the Cheif of JS @Yahoo and is now the "*architect*" @PayPal.
While Crockford is an *authority* on JS he makes no 
attempt to teach *beginners*. This is a tragegy which I intend to remedy.

Watch Crockford's Intro to JS: http://youtu.be/v2ifWcnQs6M
its a *fantastic* video if you already have programming *experience*,
but for people *without* CS Degrees it uses *way* 
**too many technical terms**.



A few of Douglas Crockford's *best* videos:
JavaScript: Your New Overload: http://youtu.be/Trurfqh_6fQ
JavaScript: Really. JavaScript: http://youtu.be/lTWGoL1N-Kc


### Basic Data Types


### Functions

### Test *First* Development

One of my biggest gripes with *all* the "Beginners" JavaScript Books I've read
is that they either don't cover testing *at all* or have an *afterthought* 
chapter towards the end of the book like 

> oh, and there's this thing called "*testing*" which you really should do...

Meanwhile most books teach you a heap of **bad habits** which are very 
difficult to correct later on.
