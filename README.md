================

Learning JavaScript is no longer *optional* for people that want to build
amazing websites, apps and experiences. But getting started can be daunting.
A quick 
[search for JavaScript](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=javascript) 
on Amazon yields over *five thousand results*! Mercifully you do not have 
to be overwhelmed by the ocean of books/tutorials/videos!

Unlike most of my colleagues I am not a (formally trained) Computer Scientist
or "Software Engineer", I created my own curriculum and learned by doing.
To a non-programmer it might look like I *bluffed* my way into getting paid
to write code, but that could not be further from the truth. 
With enough dedication, coding is something *anyone* can learn.


### Option 1

Read a *mountain* of books to acquire the knowledge of expert developers.

Here are 10 I have learned a lot from and *recommend*:

- Javascript for **Beginners** (Mark Lassoff 2013):
