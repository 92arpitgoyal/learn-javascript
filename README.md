================

Learning JavaScript is no longer *optional* for people that want to build
amazing websites, apps and experiences. But getting started can be daunting.
A quick 
[search for JavaScript](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=javascript) 
on Amazon yields over *five thousand results*! Mercifully you do not have 
to be overwhelmed by the ocean of books/tutorials/videos!

Unlike most of my colleagues I am not a (formally trained) Computer Scientist
or "Software Engineer", I created my own curriculum and learned by doing.
To a non-programmer it might look like I *bluffed* my way into getting paid
to write code, but that could not be further from the truth. 
With enough dedication, coding is something *anyone* can learn.

# Where do I Start?!

## Option 1

Read a *shelf* of books to acquire the knowledge of *expert* developers.

Here are 10 I have learned a lot from and *recommend*:

Since JavaScript does not operate in isolation in the Web Browser,
you will need to have a bit of HTML & CSS knowledge to get started
(the JavaScript chapter in this first book was outsourced so *skip* it!):

- Learning Web Design: A Beginner's Guide to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and 
Web Graphics (Jennifer Niederst Robbins 2012 - **624** pages)
http://www.amazon.com/Learning-Web-Design-Beginners-JavaScript/dp/1449319270/

![Learning Web Design, 4th Edition](http://it-ebooks.info/images/ebooks/3/learning_web_design_4th_edition.jpg "Learning Web Design, 4th Edition")

Once you have some foundational web development skills you can pick a book
that is *focussed* on learning JavaScript with plenty of tutorials:

- Javascript for **Beginners** (Mark Lassoff 2013 - **292** pages):
http://www.amazon.com/Javascript-Beginners-Mr-Mark-Lassoff/dp/0988842955/

![Javascript for Beginners](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51%2B0LwpmLqL._SY344_PJlook-inside-v2,TopRight,1,0_SH20_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg "Javascript for Beginners")

Once you have learned basics you need to focus on "**The Good Parts**":

- JavaScript **The Good Parts** (Douglas Crockford 2008 - **147** pages): 
http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742/

![JavaScript: The Good Parts](http://it-ebooks.info/images/ebooks/3/javascript_the_good_parts.jpg "JavaScript: The Good Parts")

Once you have *mastered* the **Good Parts**, begin to *hone* your **craft**
by learning the correct "**Patterns**" for writing efficient code:

- JavaScript **Patterns** (Stoyan Stefanov 2010 - **236** pages): 
http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Patterns-Stoyan-Stefanov/dp/0596806752/

![JavaScript Patterns](http://it-ebooks.info/images/ebooks/3/javascript_patterns.jpg "JavaScript Patterns")

- Learning JavaScript **Design Patterns** (Andy Osmani 2012 - **254** pages):
http://www.amazon.com/Learning-JavaScript-Design-Patterns-Osmani/dp/1449331815/

![Learning JavaScript Design Patterns](http://it-ebooks.info/images/ebooks/3/learning_javascript_design_patterns.jpg "Learning JavaScript Design Patterns")

Now that you know the language *patterns* 
its time for **Test Driven Development** (TDD):

- **Test-Driven** JavaScript Development (Christian Johansen, 2010 - **600** pages):
http://www.amazon.com/Test-Driven-JavaScript-Development-Developers-Library/dp/0321683919/

![Test-Driven JavaScript Development](http://it-ebooks.info/images/ebooks/10/test-driven_javascript_development.jpg "Test-Driven JavaScript Development")

- **Testable** JavaScript (Mark Ethan Trostler 2013 - **274** pages): 
http://www.amazon.com/Testable-JavaScript-Mark-Ethan-Trostler/dp/1449323391/

![Testable JavaScript](http://it-ebooks.info/images/ebooks/3/testable_javascript.jpg "Testable JavaScript")

And if you plan on working in a **team** of more than **one** person, 
you will need to ensure your code is **maintainable**:

- Maintainable JavaScript (Nicholas C. Zakas 2010 - **242** pages):
http://www.amazon.com/Maintainable-JavaScript-Nicholas-C-Zakas/dp/1449327680/

![Maintainable JavaScript](http://it-ebooks.info/images/ebooks/3/maintainable_javascript.jpg "Maintainable JavaScript")

Now you are getting quite good at but your JS code is still not *performing*
like *Google*'s ...

- **High Performance** JavaScript (Nicholas C. Zakas 2010 - **242** pages):
http://www.amazon.com/Performance-JavaScript-Faster-Application-Interfaces/dp/059680279X/

![High Performance JavaScript](http://it-ebooks.info/images/ebooks/3/high_performance_javascript.jpg "High Performance JavaScript")

You're feeling pretty *confident* in your JS skills you want to take it to
"**Ninja**" Level:

- Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja (John Resig 2012 - **392** pages):
http://www.amazon.com/Secrets-JavaScript-Ninja-John-Resig/dp/193398869X/
